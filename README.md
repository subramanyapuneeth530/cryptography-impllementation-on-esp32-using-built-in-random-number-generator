# cryptography-impllementation-on-esp32-using-built-in-random-number-generator
This Markdown explains an Arduino sketch for ESP32 that demonstrates authenticated encryption using ChaCha20-Poly1305 (AEAD) via the rweather Crypto library. The program generates a random 32-byte key and a 12-byte nonce per message (built from a 4-byte random prefix and an 8-byte counter), treats the counter as AAD (additional authenticated data) to catch reordering/tampering, and then encrypts whatever you type over Serial. It immediately decrypts/validates the result and prints timings. It’s a teaching demo — it even prints the key (do not do that in real systems).
